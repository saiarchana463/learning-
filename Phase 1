click on "comment" symbol. 
you will find all the versions. 
select the version you need and open it. 
select "view" option ,you will get the that version. 

DEALING WITH BRANCH:
let's imagine you are working on 4.0 version and need to add some more information to 4.0 version. 
Then you will make it as 4.1 version but You are not sure that information need to be added or not. . 
If we make changes we may lose the version so we can create another branch while making commit .
Now you can work on 2 versions at a time as they 2 are in different branches. 

thank you .
